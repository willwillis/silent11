# Personal Website Made Easy

Ecclesiastical leaders in my youth referred to me as "super slack". I'd like to think they
saw similarities in my behavior with the 3 virtues of a [perl] programmer: [laziness, impatience, and hubris](https://wiki.c2.com/?LazinessImpatienceHubris).

So why not leverage 11ty-plain-bootstrap5 for the 2nd incarnation of this site/blog?

<!--
My first personal website was built with HTML by hand, more specifically, it was in `.shtml`, where each post
was represented as a `.shtml` file, with the main page calling each post as an include. This was a primitive
approach, but it was the beginning of my laziness.

I wrote several simple blogging/journal engines that served me well, if only to perseve memories for myself.

I eventually adoped MovableType, I developed a simple template and MT took care of the rest, comments, layouts
archives, and back-end post management.

Then MT evolved... like any good software project, the template engine became more powerful and robust
(read: confusingly overkill for my needs). I upgraded my site, and realized it would be more work than I wanted to
bring my cool "theme" over to the new version. I tweaked fewer things, the site looked more corporate than personal,
the post administration panels even looked like work. This would significantly reduce my frequency of posting.

Eventually I stopped all together. I moved my blog from `/` to `/blog`, so it would draw less attention. As if I had
many followers...

MT upgrades became more difficult, and I started having compatibility issues between the platform and my cheap-o shared hosting environment.

I exported the site as static HTML and left it to rot in `/blog` for good. I believe my last post was around 2009.

# Present Day

Enter 2023. `JavaScript` rules the web space now. Personal sites that should have and would have been simple HTML sites are now generated by gigabites upon gigabites of JS files in a `node_modules` directory.

My 2nd hosting provider is getting too expensive for what they're offering, and as I consider moving, I get this itch to
start anew. Today may be the last time I touch this. Maybe, maybe not. Time will tell.

# Full Circle

I almost forgot. I'm lazy. I'm done with blogging platforms that save blobs in a database, and metadata in various tables, etc.. etc.. I want easy, lazy markdown files. 11ty gives me this. So I'm kicking the tires on it. Frankly it's still redicilous that this is a node project, but what isn't these days... anyway. I have nothing better to do, so 11/22/22 I'm rolling out a new site.

kinda fitting, for silent11 that it would be published with 11ty, the 2nd iteration of my blog being born on the 22nd day of the 22nd year. ( a stretch, but you know what I mean.) -->
